# Task No. A1T4

## Task Requirements
We can use a simple way to encrypt English letters by using a formula to calculate the code for an English letter: `code = (ASCII code of the letter) * 7 + 5`. With this formula, we know that the code for the letter `a` is `97 * 7 + 5 = 684`. Now please write a program to decode the number inputted from a user, i.e., if the user inputs `684`, your program will print out the English letter `a`. If user input a number that is not the code of any English letter, the program gives a warning. In this program, the coding formula is `code = (ASCII code of the letter) * 7 + 5`.
