# Task No. L6T3
## Task Requirements
Assume that a student has 6 courses in one semester. Write a program to input grades for all the courses and the units for each course (units can only be 1 or 3 in UIC) and then calculate sGPA (semester GPA) for this semester.
Grades and points:

A: 4, B: 3, C: 2, D: 1, F: 0.

Assumption: Consider exactly 6 courses. GPA calculation method: $$\frac{\sum(\text{points} * \text{units})}{\sum \text{units}}$$

For example, if a student gets A, B, A, F, D, and C for six courses, the units for these six courses are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 3 respectively, then the sGPA is $$\frac{4*3 + 3*1 + 4*3 + 0*3 + 1*1 + 2*3}{3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3} = 2.43$$
