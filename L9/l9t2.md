# Task No. L9T2

## Task Requirements
Write a recursive function that can determine how many `m factors` are part of `n`. For example, `n = 48` and `m = 4`. Since `48 = 4 * 4 * 3`, i.e., `4` appears twice as a factor, then the recursive function should return `2`. **`Both`** `m` and `n` are integers. Output a warning if `m` or `n` is not bigger than 1.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**This program should include two functions:**
1.	The main function will read values of `n` and `m` and pass the values to the recursive function. 
2.	The recursive function should return the number of `m factors` of `n`. 
3.	In the main function, please read `n` and `m` using the following statement: `scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);` That is, read `n` and `m` in the designated sequence.
