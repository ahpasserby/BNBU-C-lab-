# Task No. A1T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to input a positive integer which has exactly two digits (assume users always input correctly) and output a reversed number. For example, if the input is `24`, the output is `42`; if input is `20`, output is `2`. 

## Non-Functional Requirements

You **cannot** output the reversed number digit by digit. For example, you can use one `%d` to output a number `42`, but you cannot use `%d%d` to output `4` and `2` respectively.

## I/O samples

Sample 1
```
42
reversed number: 24
Press any key to continue ...
```

Sample 2
```
20
reversed number: 2
Press any key to continue ...
```

Sample 3
```
55
reversed number: 55
Press any key to continue ...
```
