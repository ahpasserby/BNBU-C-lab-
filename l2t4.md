## Task Requirements
If `ch` is a char variable, then we can use `ch = getchar()` statement to read a character from keyboard and assign the char to `ch`. We can also use `putchar(ch)` statement to output the value of the variable `ch` to screen. Write a program to read a character and then output it. 

Attention: In the sample output, "Read a character from keyboard: " and "Output the character: " can be produced from the printf statement.
