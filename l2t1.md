# Task No. L2T1

## Task Requirements
The operator `sizeof` gives the number of bytes used for storing a datum of certain type in computer. For example, the result of `sizeof(int)` is `4` because 4 bytes are used to save an int type datum. The following statement 

```c
printf("Number of bytes used to store an int type variable is %d\n", sizeof(int));
```
will produce the following output:
```
Number of bytes used to store an int type variable is 4
```

Please write a program to produce the output in the following format:

```
Number of bytes used to store a char type variable is __
Number of bytes used to store a short int type variable is __
Number of bytes used to store an int type variable is __
Number of bytes used to store a float type variable is __
Number of bytes used to store a long int type variable is __
Number of bytes used to store a double type variable is __
```
