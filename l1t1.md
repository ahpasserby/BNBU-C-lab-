# Task No. L1T1

## Task Requirements
Sometimes in writing code, you might delete some sentences but then regret. One of the usages of comments is to shield (but not delete) some sentences so that they are not functioning temporarily. Once the comment symbols are removed, the sentences can be recovered. For example, 


<table>
<tr>
    <th>Program A Code</th>
    <th>Program A with last printf sentence commented</th>
    <th>Program A with first sentence commented</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    printf(“Hello, John\n”);
    printf(“Hello, David\n”);
    printf(“Hello, UIC\n”);
    return 0;
}
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    printf(“Hello, John\n”);
    printf(“Hello, David\n”);
    //printf(“Hello, UIC\n”);
    return 0;
}
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    //printf(“Hello, John\n”);
    printf(“Hello, David\n”);
    printf(“Hello, UIC\n”);
    return 0;
}
</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><pre>
Hello, John
Hello, David
Hello, UIC
</pre></th>
<th><pre>
Hello, John
Hello, David
</pre></th>
<th><pre>
Hello, David
Hello, UIC
</pre></th>
</tr>
</table>

Now, please write a program B with three or more printf statements. When the first sentence is commented, its output is 

```
My name is ***
My student ID is ###
```

When the second sentence is commented, the output is

```
I am a programmer
My student ID is ###
```

Submit the program B with no sentence commented.
Note: `***`, `###`, must be your real name and student ID.
