# Task No. L4T1

## Task Requirements
Write a program to read two integers `m` and `n`, and calculate the sum, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder and division. Assume that `n` is never 0. The output should look like:
```
_ + _ = _
_ ‚Äê _ = _
_ * _ = _
_ / _ = _
_ % _ = _
float( _ ) / _ = _
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

variable name should be `m` and `n`

## I/O samples

Sample 1
```
10 3
10 + 3 = 13
10 - 3 = 7
10 * 3 = 30
10 / 3 = 3
10 % 3 = 1
float(10) / 3 = 3.333333
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 2
```
-10 3
-10 + 3 = -7
-10 - 3 = -13
-10 * 3 = -30
-10 / 3 = -3
-10 % 3 = -1
float(-10) / 3 = -3.333333
Press any key to continue...
```
