# Task No. A3T3

## Task Requirements
Write a program to find and print out all the prime numbers between `5` and `100` inclusive.

## Non-Functional Requirements

The program should include two functions: a `main` function and a sub-function `_Bool isPrime(int n)`. If `n` is a prime number, the function `isPrime` will return `1` otherwise return `0`. Two functions are put in two `.c` file (one for `main` function, one for `isPrime`) and one `.h` file (for the prototype of sub-function). 

## I/O samples

Here list only prime numbers between 5 and 10 inclusive. You need to list more according to the requirements.
