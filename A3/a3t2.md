# Task No. A3T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to read a sequence of integers followed by `-1`. `-1` is used to indicate the end of input. If during the input, a negative number (except -1) or `0` is inputted, it should be discarded. Store the positive numbers in an array and then sort the array in ascending order and print the sorted positive numbers. All the numbers inputted after `-1` are not accepted. For example, if input sequence is
``` 
12 14 15 -5 1 4 -1 10 20
```
then only `12`, `14`, `15`, `1`, and `4` are stored in the array. After sorting, the data stored in array should be 
```
1 4 12 14 15
```
This is the sequence to be printed out in the end.
